More details on the code:-

This code creates a webpage that allows the user to input a website URL and add it to a list of saved websites. 

When the user adds a website, a new tab is opened with the website URL and the page is set to refresh every X seconds based on input. 

The list of saved websites is displayed on the page and updated every time a new website is added. 

The webpage includes a simple form for inputting website URLs and a button to trigger the "addWebsite" function, which handles the logic for adding a website to the list and refreshing the page.
